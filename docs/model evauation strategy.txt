Option 1: Start with maximized prompts, then choose a model
Pros:

You see what each model is truly capable of under optimal conditions.

You can make a decision based on best-case outputs.

Useful when you care about final quality above all, especially for user-facing generative content (e.g., stories, product descriptions, summarizations).

Cons:

Prompt engineering takes time, and results can vary between models (what works well for GPT-4 may underperform on Claude or Gemini).

You may optimize a prompt for a model that turns out too costly or slow for your production constraints.

Option 2: Start with simple prompts, pick a model, then optimize prompts
Pros:

Faster evaluation loop — less time spent engineering prompts at the start.

Good for early-stage development, especially when you're still figuring out cost, latency, and API ergonomics.

You only invest in prompt engineering for the model you're going to use.

Cons:

May underestimate a model's potential (especially if it's sensitive to prompt structure).

Might lead you to discard a powerful model too early just because the base prompt wasn’t a good fit.

✅ Best Practice (Hybrid Approach)
Start with a reasonably informative “mid-level” prompt — not too basic, but not deeply optimized.

Run a small benchmark across a few models using the same prompt.

Choose 2-3 top contenders based on quality, speed, and cost.

Then, do targeted prompt engineering for those few models to fully unlock their potential.

Run a final evaluation.

Summary:
Stage	If you're optimizing for...
Start with simple prompt	Speed, cost, quick prototyping
Start with max prompt	Output quality, final production use
Hybrid	Balanced and scalable development
